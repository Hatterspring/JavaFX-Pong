This is a simple pong game made by myself as a testing space for javaFX. Built in Java 8, it is designed to support future versions of java as well.

Simply run the batch file corresponding to your OS, and the batch file will add the javaFX SDK to the jar file, meaning it can run on a more recent version of java.

This project also includes the javaFX SDK. I do not own the javaFX SDK in any way, and it is included purely for the purposes of compiling the .jar file on later versions. More information in SDKs/LICENSE and SDKs/README
